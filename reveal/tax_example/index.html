	<h2>What is fat tax?</h2>
	A <b>fat tax</b> is a tax or surcharge that is placed upon fattening food, beverages or on overweight individuals.
	A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity.

	<h2>Effects</h2>
	<section>
		Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.
		Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.

		However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.

	<h2>Problems</h2>
	A carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.
	For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.
