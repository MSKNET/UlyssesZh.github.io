Last time in [this post](/music/2020/03/27/notes-frequency.html),
I introduced the octave group, before which time I defined an
interesting group
\begin{equation\*}
    Q:=\left\\{\frac kl\middle|
    k\in\left[0,l\right)\cap\mathbb Z\right\\}
\end{equation\*}
with group operation
\begin{equation\*}
    q_1\circ q_2:=\left\\{q_1+q_2\right\\},
\end{equation\*}
where $\left\\{x\right\\}:=x-\left\lfloor x\right\rfloor$.
This group has so many interesting properties that I want to
create a new post to research.
